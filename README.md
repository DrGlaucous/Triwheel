# Triwheel
This small repository contains my early developments in creating a new type of flywheel cage for shooting nerf Rival balls. Also included is some rudimentary code for the math that operated behind the scenes. The project, of course, has advanced far beyond this, and you can see the final product in my other repositories,  namely the [G2 "Twister"](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/G2), a complete hobby-grade blaster based on this principle. While you're at it, it would be worth your while to also check out the [G3 "SuperCell"](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/G2), a large-capacity automated ball hopper for the Twister.

Enjoy.
